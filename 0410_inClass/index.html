    <!-- Add a link in this paragraph where it says "the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision" -->

    <p>Far from settling the legal issue of abortion—by sending it back to the states—the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision opens an uncharted legal dimension where the health of a pregnant person is being pitted against the life of a fetus, with potentially fatal consequences. “Flat out, women will die in the course of ordinary pregnancy,” the staff writer Jia Tolentino says, “because of physician fears about anything that might make them liable for felony changes of performing an abortion.” She talks with Stephania Taladrid, who reported from a Houston abortion clinic when the decision was announced. Plus, the New Yorker staff writer Patrick Radden Keefe tells the story of Astrid Holleeder, the sister of an internationally known criminal, who turned on her brother and testified against him at trial.</p>
